 <p>As I show in my book,<span class ="comma" > </span>the fascination Elisabeth held for Proust began twenty years before he published the inaugural volume of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the <em>Recherche</em>.<span class ="period" > </span>He spotted her for the first time--from afar--at a society ball in Paris in the summer of<span class ="after_f" > </span>1893,<span class ="comma" > </span>when he was<span class ="before_number" > </span>22 and she<span class ="before_number" > </span>33.<span class ="period" > </span>Afterward he recorded:<span class ="colon" > </span>“Never before have I seen a woman so beautiful.”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span> <span class="marginnote">As it happened,<span class ="comma" > </span>this view was shared by virtually everyone except her husband,<span class ="comma" > </span>the loutish and philandering Henry,<span class ="comma" > </span>comte Greffulhe,<span class ="comma" > </span>whose erotic preferences ran to blue-eyed blondes,<span class ="comma" > </span>and who had married the dark-haired,<span class ="comma" > </span>dark-eyed Elisabeth chiefly for her pedigree.<span class ="period" > </span>Proust would later ascribe the couple’s marital dynamic to that of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the duc and duchesse de Guermantes,<span class ="comma" > </span>describing Oriane as<span class ="before_quotes" > </span>“the most beautiful,<span class ="comma" > </span>and the most cheated-on,<span class ="comma" > </span>woman in Paris.”</span> For almost a year after this initial sighting,<span class ="comma" > </span>Proust pleaded with one of<span class ="after_f" > </span>her kinsmen,<span class ="comma" > </span>comte Robert de Montesquiou Fezensac,<span class ="comma" > </span>to present him to her.<span class ="period" > </span>Montesquiou,<span class ="comma" > </span>a highborn and very haughty gay aesthete who seemed to enjoy putting Proust,<span class ="comma" > </span>a mere commoner,<span class ="comma" > </span>in his place,<span class ="comma" > </span>repeatedly refused the request,<span class ="comma" > </span>once explaining with a sneer:<span class ="colon" > </span>"Do you not see that your presence in<span class ="before_paren" > </span>[the comtesse Greffulhe’s] salon would rob it of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the very elegance you hope to find there?"</p>
 <p> <figure><span class="marginnote">This is the caption for Monetesquiou’s image.</span><img src="/images/Whistler_Montesquiou.jpg"></figure></p>
 <p>However,<span class ="comma" > </span>Montesquiou had an insatiable appetite for publicity,<span class ="comma" > </span>and in May<span class ="before_number" > </span>1894,<span class ="comma" > </span>Proust offered to help feed it by chronicling for a leading society newspaper an exclusive garden party the comte was planning to hold at the pavillon Montesquiou in Versailles.<span class ="period" > </span>This was Proust’s way in.<span class ="period" > </span>In order to write about the gathering,<span class ="comma" > </span>he would have to be invited to it,<span class ="comma" > </span>and since Elisabeth was to be the guest of<span class ="after_f" > </span>honor,<span class ="comma" > </span>Montesquiou would be forced to introduce them:<span class ="colon" > </span>etiquette demanded that all guests be presented to the de facto queen of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the occasion.</p>
 <p>And so,<span class ="comma" > </span>on May<span class ="before_number" > </span>31,<span class ="comma" > </span>1894,<span class ="comma" > </span>at the comte’s lordly,<span class ="comma" > </span>neoclassical residence in Versailles,<span class ="comma" > </span>Proust was granted his heart’s desire.<span class ="period" > </span>Sweltering in his frock coat,<span class ="comma" > </span>top hat,<span class ="comma" > </span>and gloves beneath a blazing summer sun,<span class ="comma" > </span>he met Elisabeth at last.<span class ="period" > </span>She had dressed for the party in a delicate,<span class ="comma" > </span>fashionably mauve confection by the great couturier Charles Frederick Worth,<span class ="comma" > </span>its silk skirt hand-painted with orchids and overlain with petal-pink tulle.<span class ="period" > </span>In her chestnut-brown curls she wore a headdress trimmed with real orchids,<span class ="comma" > </span>and her face was wrapped--“like a precious fruit,”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span>as she phrased it in one of<span class ="after_f" > </span>her many unpublished writings--in an opaque,<span class ="comma" > </span>mauve veil.<span class ="period" > </span>While these accessories did not survive,<span class ="comma" > </span>Elisabeth carefully preserved the Worth dress for posterity.<span class ="period" > </span>After her death,<span class ="comma" > </span>her heirs gifted it to Paris’s Musee Galliera,<span class ="comma" > </span>which recently displayed it in an exhibition that subsequently traveled to the FIT museum in New York.<span class ="period" > </span>Here is the ensemble she wore on that day:</p>
