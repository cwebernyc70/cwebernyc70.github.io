<h2>Writing Posts</h2>
<h4>Sunday January 1, 2023</h4>
<p>This post has some general information about how to write a post.<span class ="period" > </span></p>
 <h2>Meta Data</h2>
 <p>The material at the top of<span class ="after_f" > </span>one of<span class ="after_f" > </span>these files,<span class ="comma" > </span>on lines that start with two periods,<span class ="comma" > </span>is<span class ="before_quotes" > </span>“meta data”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span>about the post.</p>
 <h2>Title</h2>
 <p>The title is what the web page will display.<span class ="period" > </span>There are no restrictions on this.</p>
 <h2>Date</h2>
 <p>The date will be displayed below the title.<span class ="period" > </span>Enter it here in year-month-day form:<span class ="colon" > </span>yyyy-mm-dd.<span class ="period" > </span>You will be able to see posts with a date in the future on the staging version of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the website is visible only on this computer.<span class ="period" > </span>The website visible to the outside world will not display them until the date is current or in the past.</p>
 <p>Using a date in the near future lets you schedule in advance when a post goes live.<span class ="period" > </span>In the meantime,<span class ="comma" > </span>you can still preview it on this machine.<span class ="period" > </span> A post like this one with a date in the far future lets us have posts visible only to you and me.<span class ="period" > </span>They give you a way to experiment and to save information for reference.</p>
 <h2>The slug</h2>
 <p>The slug will end up being both the name of<span class ="after_f" > </span>this file and part of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the url for finding the webpage.<span class ="period" > </span>Because it is part of<span class ="after_f" > </span>the url,<span class ="comma" > </span>it must not have any spaces or any capital letters.</p>
 <p>You can save this file with any name you want,<span class ="comma" > </span>e.g.<span class ="period" > </span>newpost.md.<span class ="period" > </span>Overnight,<span class ="comma" > </span>a program that works in the background will use the slug to rename it as<span class ="before_number" > </span>1_writing_posts.md.<span class ="period" > </span>The leading tilde shows that this is a post in the future.<span class ="period" > </span>Together,<span class ="comma" > </span>the numbers and the tilde help organize the posts so that they show up in the panel on the left in the order implied by the dates in the meta data.<span class ="period" > </span>It is ok for these file names to change.<span class ="period" > </span>What should not change after a post goes live,<span class ="comma" > </span>is the slug.</p>
 <p>As you will see on the local staging website,<span class ="comma" > </span>the url for this post will be</p>
 <blockquote><p>sitename/posts/writing_posts</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>On the staging site,<span class ="comma" > </span>“sitename”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span>will be the ugly string<span class ="before_quotes" > </span>“127.0.0.1:7600”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span>On the web,<span class ="comma" > </span>it will be:<span class ="colon" > </span> "carolineweber.net"</p>
 <p>Search engines use the words in the url to guide people to pages,<span class ="comma" > </span>so it is good to have some descriptive terms in the slug.</p>
 <h2>Markdown Preview</h2>
 <p>If<span class ="after_f" > </span>you use the key combination Control + Shift + M,<span class ="comma" > </span>a preview window will open on the right.<span class ="period" > </span>It gives you a hint about how your text will be formatted on the webpage.</p>
 <p>Open up the preview window.<span class ="period" > </span>For example,<span class ="comma" > </span>notice how the<span class ="before_quotes" > </span>“&gt;<span class ="semicolon" > </span>”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span> before the URL three paragraphs back sets it off<span class ="after_f" > </span>as a block quote.<span class ="period" > </span>As you know,<span class ="comma" > </span>inclosing a phrase with a pair of<span class ="after_f" > </span>single asterisk gives you italics:<span class ="colon" > </span><em>text in an italic face.</em> Doubled asterisks gives bold face:<span class ="colon" > </span><strong>Text that will display in boldface.</strong></p>
 <p>For each post,<span class ="comma" > </span>there will be a short excerpt that shows on any listing of<span class ="after_f" > </span>posts,<span class ="comma" > </span>e.g.<span class ="period" > </span>on the home page or the blog page.<span class ="period" > </span>You can put   anyplace where you want the short excerpt from the post to end.<span class ="period" > </span>You can put it even in the middle of<span class ="after_f" > </span>a sentence.<span class ="period" > </span>In the full post,<span class ="comma" > </span>this tag   will be replaced by a single space between the two words,<span class ="comma" > </span>in this case,<span class ="comma" > </span>between<span class ="before_quotes" > </span>“put”<span class ="after_quotes" > </span>and "anyplace"</p>
 <p>The excerpt will end with a link to the full post and any text you want.<span class ="period" > </span>Usually,<span class ="comma" > </span>it is "Read more ..."</p>
 <p>There is a separate post like this one on how to manage figures.</p>
